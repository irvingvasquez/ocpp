Field surveying by drones has become a successful activity with applications to mapping, precision agriculture, surveillance, etc. The current state of the art path planners for surveying rely on computing the path that minimizes the number of flight lines. However, such approach could be sub-optimal when the takeoff and landing points are included in the path. We propose a method that computes the optimal path, including the takeoff and landing points. Our method is based on the rotating calipers algorithm and it has a *O(n)* complexity.

Path example:

The algorithm as been coded on matlab. In addition, the Torres's algorithm has been also implemented for comparison purposes. The code was tested for the last time on MatLab2019b.

The planner was early published as a conference paper:

Later, a deeper study of the algorithm was done in our Journal paper, where we call it "the rotating calipers path planner" (RCPP):

## Short Usage Tutorial

### Polygons 

The polygons are specified as a M x 2 matrix. Where M is the amount of vertices. Ranndom polygons cab ne created with the function getConvexPolygon. A polygon can also be read from a CSV file with *loadPolygonCSV* function.

### Testing RCPP

The easiest way is to read or create a plygon and call the CPP function.
